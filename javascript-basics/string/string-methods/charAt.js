   *Syntax*

    *Parameters*
        index

        An integer between 0 and str.length - 1. If the index cannot be converted to the integer or no index 
        is provided, the default is 0, so the first character of str is returned.

    *Return value*
        A string representing the character (exactly one UTF-16 code unit) at the specified index. If index 
        is out of range, charAt() returns an empty string.

  /**Description
            Characters in a string are indexed from left to right. The index of the first character is 0, and 
            the index of the last characterâ€”in a string called stringName is stringName.length - 1. If the index 
            you supply is out of this range, JavaScript returns an empty string.

            If no index is provided to charAt(), the default is 0.
